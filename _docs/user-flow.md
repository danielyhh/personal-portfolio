User Flow: Personal Portfolio Website
This document outlines the typical step-by-step journey a user would take when interacting with the personal portfolio website, mapping their encounter, main interactions, and navigation.

1. How Users First Encounter the App
Direct Access: User types the URL directly into their browser, clicks a link from a search engine result, or accesses it from a resume/CV.

Social Media/Professional Platform Referral: User clicks a link to the portfolio shared on LinkedIn, Twitter, or other professional/social networks.

2. The Onboarding Process
Note: For a personal portfolio website, there is typically no formal "onboarding" process (e.g., account creation, guided tour). The site is designed for immediate consumption of content.

Upon initial arrival, the user is immediately presented with the Homepage. The Homepage acts as a welcoming introduction, featuring a hero section designed to quickly convey who the portfolio owner is and what they do.
