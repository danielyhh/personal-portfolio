Tech Stack: Personal Portfolio Website
This document outlines the technical choices for the personal portfolio website, focusing on TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS as the core foundation, and detailing other necessary tools.

1. Frontend Framework
Industry Standard Option: React, Angular, Vue.js (all widely used, React is arguably most popular for web apps).

Popular Open-Source Alternative: Svelte, SolidJS, Preact.

Chosen Option and Why: React.

Why: Specified as the foundation in the project brief. It offers a component-based architecture which promotes reusability and maintainability, a large community, extensive libraries, and strong job market demand. Its virtual DOM ensures efficient updates.

Best Practices and Limitations:

Best Practices: Use functional components and hooks for state management. Break down UI into small, reusable components. Use PropTypes or TypeScript for prop validation. Optimize performance with React.memo and useCallback/useMemo where appropriate. Implement error boundaries.

Limitations: Can have a steeper learning curve for beginners compared to simpler libraries. Performance issues can arise if not optimized properly (e.g., excessive re-renders).

Key Conventions to Follow:

Components will be functional.

Use JSX for UI definition.

State management primarily with useState and useEffect hooks for local component state, potentially useContext for global state if simple.

2. Styling
Industry Standard Option: CSS-in-JS libraries (e.g., Styled Components, Emotion), CSS Modules, utility-first frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS).

Popular Open-Source Alternative: Bootstrap, Bulma, Materialize CSS.

Chosen Option and Why: Tailwind CSS.

Why: Specified as the foundation. It's a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development by composing classes directly in the HTML/JSX. It's highly customizable and encourages consistent design systems.

Best Practices and Limitations:

Best Practices: Leverage Tailwind's utility classes for almost all styling. Use responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:) for adaptive designs. Create custom components or use @apply sparingly for complex, repetitive patterns.

Limitations: Can lead to "class soup" in HTML for highly complex components if not managed well. Requires a build process to purge unused CSS for production.

Key Conventions to Follow:

All styling will be done directly with Tailwind CSS utility classes within JSX.

No custom CSS files unless absolutely necessary for very specific, non-utility scenarios.

Prioritize responsive classes for mobile-first development.

3. Database
Industry Standard Option: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase Firestore.

Popular Open-Source Alternative: SQLite (for local/small projects), Supabase (PostgreSQL alternative with extra features).

Chosen Option and Why: None (Not Required for MVP).

Why: The initial project scope (About, 3 Project Showcases, Contact Form) does not inherently require a persistent database for content storage. Project details and About content can be hardcoded or managed via static data (e.g., a JSON file). The contact form will use a third-party service.

Best Practices and Limitations: N/A for MVP. If content grows, consider a headless CMS or a simple JSON file approach.

Key Conventions to Follow: N/A.

4. Authentication
Industry Standard Option: OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Auth0), Firebase Authentication, custom JWT-based systems.

Popular Open-Source Alternative: NextAuth.js (for Next.js projects), Clerk.

Chosen Option and Why: None (Not Required).

Why: A personal portfolio website typically does not require user authentication. It's a public-facing site.

Best Practices and Limitations: N/A.

5. Hosting
Industry Standard Option: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS Amplify, Firebase Hosting.

Popular Open-Source Alternative: N/A (most major options are proprietary services with free tiers).

Chosen Option and Why: Vercel (Recommended for React/Next.js projects).

Why: Offers excellent developer experience, integrates seamlessly with GitHub for continuous deployment, provides automatic SSL, and has a generous free tier suitable for static sites and frontend applications like a portfolio. Netlify is a strong alternative.

Best Practices and Limitations:

Best Practices: Use continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) by connecting to a GitHub repository. Optimize build times. Utilize caching.

Limitations: Free tier has limitations on build minutes and serverless function invocations (not an issue for this project).

Key Conventions to Follow:

Deployment will be managed via a connected GitHub repository.

The build command will generate a static site for deployment.

6. Other Necessary Tools
TypeScript:

Why: Specified as the foundation. Provides static type-checking, catching errors early and improving code readability and maintainability, especially in larger projects.

Best Practices: Define clear interfaces for props and state. Use strict mode where possible.

Conventions: All new .js files will be .tsx or .ts.

NPM/Yarn:

Why: Package managers for installing and managing project dependencies.

Conventions: Prefer NPM for consistency.

EmailJS (or similar service for Contact Form):

Why: Allows sending emails directly from client-side JavaScript without needing a backend server, simplifying the contact form implementation.

Conventions: Securely manage API keys and templates.

Git/GitHub:

Why: Essential for version control, collaboration, and deployment.

Conventions: Frequent commits with clear messages. Use branches for new features if collaborating.
