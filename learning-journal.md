Learning Journal: AI Engineering Intensive
This document serves as a daily log for tracking learnings, challenges, and insights gained during the 5-Day AI Engineering Intensive.

Day 1: Monday, June 30, 2025 - Foundation & First Build
Key Learnings:
Project Setup: What I learned about initializing a React project with Vite and TypeScript (e.g., specific commands, purpose of vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json).

Documentation Workflow: My experience using AI to create the _docs files and why each document (e.g., project-overview.md, phase-plan.md, theme-guide.md) is important.

Tailwind CSS Setup: How Tailwind was integrated, the role of tailwind.config.js and globals.css, and basic utility class application.

Initial Component Structure: Understanding how App.tsx brings together Header, Footer, and HomePage.

Debugging Setup Issues: The steps taken to resolve vite not recognized and dependency conflict errors (e.g., npm install --force, clearing node_modules). This was a crucial learning point!

Git Basics: What I did to initialize Git, create .gitignore, git add, and git commit.

Challenges Encountered:
Describe any problems you faced, e.g., errors in the terminal, difficulties understanding a concept.

How did you try to solve them? (e.g., searched online, re-read docs, asked the AI).

Insights & Reflections:
What was surprising or interesting today?

How does the structured documentation help the AI (and me!) build the project?

Any thoughts on the AI's assistance today?

Day 2: Tuesday, July 1, 2025 - Complete Portfolio & Start Task App
Key Learnings:
(To be filled in tomorrow after completing Day 2 tasks)

Portfolio Completion: What I learned about building the About, Projects, and Contact sections.

Contact Form Logic: How the form handles state, input, and simulated submission.

Responsive Design Principles: How sm:, md: prefixes in Tailwind make the site adapt to different screen sizes.

Task App Planning: My experience planning the new Task Tracker project and creating its initial doc.~
